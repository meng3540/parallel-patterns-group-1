In computing, patterns are a way templates of the best practices used in software engineering. They represent recurring themes and techniques that can be reused to solve different problems. The same concept applies to parallel programming where parallel patterns refer to recurring combinations of task distribution and data access that are used to solve parallel programming problems.  
Parallel patterns are significant because they offer proven techniques for solving parallel programming tasks and making them more manageable. They're used for a variety of applications such as image processing, data analytics, and AI training, where parallelizing the task speeds up processing.
