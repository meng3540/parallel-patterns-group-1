# Introduction
1) What are parallel patterns in computing? 2) What is their significance?- Explain in the context of typical applications they are used in., 3) How is heterogeneous GPU-CPU computing useful in solving a parallel pattern?

In computing, patterns are a way of codifying the best practices used in software engineering. They represent recurring themes and techniques that can be reused to solve different problems. The same concept applies to parallel programming where parallel patterns refer to recurring combinations of task distribution and data access that are used to solve parallel programming problems.
