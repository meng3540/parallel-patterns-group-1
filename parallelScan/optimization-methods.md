# Optimization
In this section, we explore two methods that prove to be rather effective in optimizing the provided Kogge-Stone parallel scan algorithm.
### Increasing Parallelism
In CUDA programming, parallel is critical for maximizing GPU efficiency, and increasing parallelism means using more threads and blocks.

### Optimizing Memory Access
